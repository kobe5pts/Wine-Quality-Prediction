# Wine Quality Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict wine quality based on its physicochemical properties. The dataset contains metrics such as acidity, sugar levels, pH, alcohol content, and more. By analyzing this data, the project aims to classify wine quality and provide actionable insights for wine producers and consumers.

## Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:
- **fixed acidity**: Concentration of non-volatile acids.
- **volatile acidity**: Concentration of volatile acids.
- **citric acid**: Citric acid content in the wine.
- **residual sugar**: Remaining sugar after fermentation (g/L).
- **chlorides**: Salt content in the wine.
- **free sulfur dioxide**: Free form of SO₂ in wine (mg/L).
- **total sulfur dioxide**: Total SO₂ (free + bound) in wine (mg/L).
- **density**: Density of the wine (g/mL).
- **pH**: Acidity of the wine.
- **sulphates**: Sulfate concentration, which contributes to preservation.
- **alcohol**: Alcohol content in the wine (%).
- **quality**: Quality score assigned to the wine (range: 3-9).
